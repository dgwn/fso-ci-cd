Let’s ssume that we are working on a Python Flask web app. We would likely use Flake8 for linting, which is capable of detecting both logical and stylistic lint. We may also use Black for formatting. For testing we would likely use unittest for unit tests or pytest due to its more simple nature. It does not appear that Flask apps need any specific build tools. One common alternative to Github and Jenkins for continuous integration is Gitlab. Travis CI is also a well known option. Due to it’s integration with github repositories where our code is likely to be hosted, we would probably use GH actions. Our CI setup would most likely be better in a cloud-based environment due to the simplicity of a web app. The environment likely does not need any custom virtual hardware such as GPUs and the default level of power provided by github actions (2 vCPUs and 8GB of RAM) should be more than sufficient for a standard CRUD app. Only if we were doing more intensive computing such as machine learning, image or video processing, etc. then would we maybe need the customization of a self-hosed CI setup. It is also likely that a cloud-based solution such as github actions would be cheaper for a smaller project such as our flask web app.
